Note: This project is related to Energy distribution in Grids. In the energy distribution system there exist an Energy company
(wholesaler) who buy electricity from energy production company. As there are lots of energy producers and the price of energy
always fluctuates due to the production criteria and source of energy, the wholesaler buys energy in the fluctuating market 
from different suppliers and sell to distributor company who have usually invested in all the wires for the distribution of 
energy to the place of consumption. The distributor company buy energy from the wholesaler in a huge mass and distribute the 
energy to the consumers. So, when we all consumers buy energy for our daily uses we are dealing with distributor company.

If not other sources, most of the electricity used to be produced by burning coal and other nonrenewable sources but now the
concept of renewable energy is in more focus due to environmental effects of nonrenewable energy. The most commons of
renewable energy sources being used in the world are wind energy and solar energy. 

As the focus of this project is an electric grid, there are two types of electricity producers in terms of level who can
contribute to the grid. First one is energy producer and wholesalers network and second is the consumer itself.
In the second case when the consumer became producer itself but still cannot fulfill own demand for energy for all time.
The consumer still needs to buy energy from the distributor but can contribute energy to the grid too when the energy produced
is not in use.  If the consumer sell this energy to the wholesaler, its possible but it became very unmanageable for a
wholesaler to buy a small amount of energy from every consumer. In addition to it, energy has to be transferred to wholesaler 
and consumers again.
(wholesaler - Global energy source )
(Houses with energy production source - Local energy source)

We came up with a better approach to this problem. Instead of selling the locally produced energy from household solar panels
and mini windmills. Our GRIDBIRD software helps to trade the energy produced by the houses with energy production sources with
other houses. Our smart bidding system can do the trading of energy between all the houses in the distribution system.
If one house wants to buy energy, the system looks for the cheapest energy price from a local source and buys energy. 
Any house in the system will sell their energy if their battery percentage is above the lower limit.
